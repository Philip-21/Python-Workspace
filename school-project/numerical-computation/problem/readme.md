 Implement the 3 approximate methods namely bisection, newton Raphson and secant method. Also implement Taylor series, Picard and Euler's methods for solving ordinary differential equations.

Your program should be allow the user to choose what he wants to do. i.e it should prompt the to chose if they want to find the root of an equation or solve and ordinary differential equation with a given value. It should also allow the user to specify which method he wants to use to solve either problems. The program should also accept inputs from the user. 

The program should also display the compile time.
